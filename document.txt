Example Document: The Solar System
The Solar System is a collection of celestial objects, including the Sun, planets, moons, asteroids, comets, and meteoroids, that are bound together by gravity. At the center is the Sun, a star that provides the energy necessary to sustain life on Earth.

1. The Sun
The Sun is the largest object in the Solar System and accounts for about 99.86% of its total mass. It is a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma and produces energy through nuclear fusion. This energy is emitted as light and heat.

2. Planets
There are eight planets in the Solar System, divided into two categories:

Terrestrial Planets: Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. These are rocky planets with solid surfaces.
Gas Giants: Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. These are much larger and composed mostly of gas and ice.
3. The Earth's Moon
Earth has one natural satellite, the Moon. It influences the tides on Earth and stabilizes the planet's axial tilt, which affects the climate.

4. Asteroids and Comets

Asteroids are rocky objects that orbit the Sun, mostly found in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter.
Comets are composed of ice, dust, and rocky material. They have tails that become visible as they approach the Sun.
5. Other Celestial Objects
The Solar System also contains meteoroids, dwarf planets like Pluto, and interstellar objects that occasionally pass through.

Interesting Facts:

Jupiter is the largest planet in the Solar System and has a Great Red Spot, a giant storm that has lasted for centuries.
Venus is the hottest planet due to its thick atmosphere, which traps heat through the greenhouse effect.
Saturn is famous for its stunning ring system, made of ice and rock particles.
The Solar System is vast, and despite centuries of study, there is still much to learn about its origins and the objects it contains.
